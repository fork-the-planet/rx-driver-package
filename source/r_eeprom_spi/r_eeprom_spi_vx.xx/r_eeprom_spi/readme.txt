r_eeprom_spi (SPI serial EEPROM control software)
=======================

Document Number 
---------------
R01AN2325EJ0321
R01AN2325JJ0321

Version
-------
v3.21

Overview
--------
The SPI Serial EEPROM control software controls the Renesas Electronics R1EX25xxx/HN58X25xxx series SPI Serial
EEPROM devices using a Renesas Electronics' microcomputer.
A clock synchronous single-master control program that is specific to the individual MCU is separately required.

Features
--------
* This softrare ia s Block type device driver, with a Renesas Electronics' MCU operating as the master device and
the Renesas Electronics R1EX25xxx/HN58X25xxx series SPI Serial EEPROM operating as the slave device.
* It controls the devices in the SPI mode using the MCU's internal serial communication function (clock synchronous
mode). It is possible to use the following FIT module for serial communication.
* It is possible to control up to two serial EEPROM.
* It is possible to set the differnt type name od serial EEPROM each device.
* Both big-endian and little-endian operation are supported. (The choice depends on the MCU used.)

Supported MCUs
--------------
* RX Family MCU

Boards Tested On
----------------
* RSK for RX
 
Limitations
-----------
None

Peripherals Used Directly
-------------------------
* I/O Ports (GPIO)

Required Packages
-----------------
* r_bsp    v7.52

How to add to your project
--------------------------
This module must be added to each project in which it is used.
Renesas recommends using "Smart Configurator" described in (1) or (2) or (4).
However, "Smart Configurator" only supports some RX devices.
Please use the methods of (3) for unsupported RX devices.

(1) Adding the FIT module to your project using "Smart Configurator" in e2 studio
By using the "Smart Configurator" in e2 studio, 
the FIT module is automatically added to your project.
Refer to "RX Smart Configurator User's Guide: e2 studio (R20AN0451)" for details.

(2) Adding the FIT module to your project using "Smart Configurator" on CS+
By using the "Smart Configurator Standalone version" in CS+,
the FIT module is automatically added to your project.
Refer to "RX Smart Configurator User's Guide: CS+ (R20AN0470)" for details.

(3) Adding the FIT module to your project in CS+
In CS+, please manually add the FIT module to your project.
Refer to "Adding Firmware Integration Technology Modules to CS+ Projects (R01AN1826)" for details.

(4)Adding the FIT module to your project using the Smart Configurator in IAREW
By using the Smart Configurator Standalone version,
the FIT module is automatically added to your project.
Refer to "RX Smart Configurator User's Guide: IAREW (R20AN0535)" for details.

Toolchain(s) Used
-----------------
* Renesas RX
* GCC for Renesas RX
* IAR C/C++ Compiler for Renesas RX
