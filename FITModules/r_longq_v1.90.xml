        <details>This module allocates a queue control block in an Open() call to handle indexing for buffers provided by the user application. Additional functions are provided to put and get data from the buffer queue, inspect the number of elements available or in use, and to flush the queue. There is no limit to the number of queues supported, and queue control blocks can be allocated statically at build time or dynamically at run time.</details>
